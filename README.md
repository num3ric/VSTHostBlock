WARNING!

THIS BLOCK IS IN DEVELOPMENT AND IT IS CERTAINLY NOT PRODUCTION READY CODE! 

For far this is some hacky way how to get VST/VSTi plugins to work with Audio2 library by [Richard Eakin](https://github.com/richardeakin) (thanks for help and support!).

__Currently supporting 2.x version plugins__

 3.x is current version and it is going to be maintained by Steinberg in future, but it has different api/sdk so that on todo list, after 2.x version is going to be completed.

__So far there is ONLY Windows support.__

 Mac version requires to add system specific functionality to handle plugin window.
